What is the purpose of the log message you supply to your git commit?

        The purpose of the log message is to document changes made to a repositry 
        and allows you to be able to make comments relating to those changes.

What do you think makes a good commit message?

        I believe a good commit message explains clearly and concisively what was changed, and why a change was made.

When and how often should I be committing my work?

        If you are working on a long term project, I believe it is important to commit as often as possible, especially 
        if you are working collaboratively as it prevents conflicting changes with other programmers and allows you to
        to simultaniously explain your contribution. Additionally it could potentially helpful identifying errors in the 
        code.

True or False, you should commit all files (including binaries, images, and log files) to Git.

Mostly true with some exceptions. You should commit everything but your output files (bin, obj directories and log files)
to Git.
